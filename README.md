# flash

Flash is a progressive web framework in TypeScript, particularly optimized for
building REST APIs on serverless platforms with Deno.

## Philosophy

Flash is designed to be...

- âš¡ ***Efficient*** - frees you from what you don't have to do
- ðŸ’“ ***Flexible*** - lets you do what you want to
- ðŸš« ***Strict*** - prohibits you from doing what you shouldn't

Yes, they are conflicting. But why not try best to achieve all?

## Usage

### Cloudflare Workers

Create a worker module file:

```typescript
// index.ts
import { flare } from "https://deno.land/x/flash/mod.ts";

export default flare({ "/": "Welcome to flash!" });
```

And deploy with [Denoflare](https://denoflare.dev/)!

```sh
$ denoflare push index.ts --name flash-demo
```

## Functionalities

### Routing by URLPattern and methods

```typescript
export default flare({
  "/": "Welcome to flash!", // for all methods
  "/users/:name": {
    GET: ({ params }) => params.name
  },
}
```
